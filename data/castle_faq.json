        "question": "Can I reserve a party or a specific area at The Castle Pub?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can reserve tables for your group free of charge, and we offer a suitable space for parties. However, please note that we do not reserve entire rooms or areas — only tables for the number of guests you have booked. Our regular business operations continue during events, and drinks must be purchased from the bar. Please also be aware that loud music and dancing are not possible, as we are primarily a bar, not a nightclub. Thank you for your understanding!"
